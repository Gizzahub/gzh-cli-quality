## Notable Test Features

### Excellent Test Practices ✅

1. **Comprehensive Table-Driven Tests**
   ```go
   tests := []struct {
       name     string
       tool     string
       expected Result
   }{
       // Multiple test cases
   }
   ```

2. **Multi-Language Tool Testing**
   - Go (golangci-lint, staticcheck, revive)
   - Python (black, pylint, mypy, ruff)
   - JavaScript/TypeScript (eslint, prettier)
   - Rust (rustfmt, clippy, cargo-fmt)

3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Tool execution benchmarks
   - Report generation benchmarks
   - Detector performance tests

4. **Output Format Validation**
   - Table format
   - JSON format
   - Markdown format
   - CSV format

### Areas for Improvement 📝

1. **Integration Tests**
   - Currently missing
   - Would validate tool chains
   - Recommended: Add `tests/integration/`

2. **E2E Tests**
   - Currently missing
   - Would validate full workflows
   - Recommended: Add `tests/e2e/`

3. **CLI Coverage**
   - 0% unit test coverage
   - Recommendation: Add CLI unit tests
